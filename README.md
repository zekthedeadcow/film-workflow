# film-workflow
This is an XML file describing my standard film production workflow using Gnome Planner

Planner was selected because it would output an XML save file, it is fairly easy to use, and had proper WBS (Work Breakdown Structure).  WBS is critical for organizing documentation and XML is critical for future portability.
